# Inuit boilerplate

Inuit boilerplate is an opinionated starter kit to help you build or prototype static marketing or content websites. It uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/) as a static site generator, [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as a worklow automation tool and [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss) as CSS framework.

The goal of this boilerplate is to make to create a library of components which are easy to use, accessible and performant. **Important**: for the moment this is not the case but it's a work in progress.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute Inuit boilerplate, even for commercial purposes, without asking for permission. For any third-party code please refer to the corresponding license included in this project.

## Roadmap
This project is still under development and will change in the future. Some things I'm working on:
- better form layout
- various lists styles
- easier to use tabs component
- add new components
- basic service worker
- documentation
